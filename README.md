Emotion Detection is an automated process capable of understanding the feelings or opinions that  underlie a text. Emotion Detection is a machine learning tool that analyzes texts for polarity, from  positive to negative. By training machine learning tools with examples of emotions in text, machines  automatically learn how to detect sentiment without human input. 
 
 Emotion Detection models can be trained to read beyond mere definitions, to understand things like,  context, sarcasm, and misapplied words.
